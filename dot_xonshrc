#
# install xonsh using mamba: https://github.com/anki-code/xonsh-install
# so it has dependent environment outside of OS' python or any other python
# 
# by default xonsh will also load files from these directories
# - ~/.config/xonsh/rc.xsh
# - ~/.config/xonsh/rc.d/*
# refs:
# - https://xon.sh/xonshrc.html
#
# however for now I decided to just put it in this one file to make things easier to find & edit
