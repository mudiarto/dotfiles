#
# NOTES:
# - install xonsh using mamba: https://github.com/anki-code/xonsh-install
#   so it has dependent environment outside of OS' python or any other python
#
# - from my testing, xonsh will load files from these location (in this order):
# - ~/.xonshrc
# - ~/.config/xonsh/rc.xsh
# - ~/.config/xonsh/rc.d/* (in sorted order)
#
